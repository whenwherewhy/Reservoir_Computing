# Reservoir_Computing : Liquid State Machine

Implementation of a liquid state machine (LSM) model using Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron model.

#Project 1 : 
- Implementing Deep Q learning using LSM as feature extractor and static dense layer as Action Decision model
- Parallelized LIF Dense Layer implementation
